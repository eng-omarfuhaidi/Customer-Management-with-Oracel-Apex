# Customer-Management-with-Oracel-Apex

I designed this simple application to manage customer data and easily search for them, whether by their names, categories, or the type of system they use, etc. An important feature has also been added to the application, which is group messages via WhatsApp based on customer categories. The user can send a different message to each group of customers or the same message to all customers regardless of their groups. To send WhatsApp messages, I used a free API from ultramsg and a paid one from 4WhatsApp in this system
